# Mental HealthA dvisor Chatbot
This chatbot is aimed at helping physical and mental health related problems by recognising problem phrases as a category of problem through a set of intents in a JSON file. Based on the intent recognised a set of followup questions will be asked by the chatbot to further evaluate what actionable steps a person needs to take to help aid the problem.

This project is still in progress so I will continue to add improvements
